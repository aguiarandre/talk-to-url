Crawler
=======================

Crawler Depth
-------------

One interesting point is that usually websites can have multiple links. One thing that might bring interesting
results is: we can use a concept of crawler depth to look for the information within N links that appear on the original URL.

For example, the crawling could be modeled as Tree and a Breadth First Search (BFS) could be applied to increase the exploration space.
